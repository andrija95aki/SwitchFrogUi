# Allium palette ports and font

Select an `alium_*` palette under Appearance â†’ Theme and `alium_Nunito`
under Appearance â†’ Font. Turn Background Images off for the plain palette.
The font is **Nunito Bold**, the exact, unmodified `Nunito.ttf` bundled with
Allium, renamed on disk to match the requested prefix. Its internal font name
remains Nunito Bold. It is licensed under SIL OFL 1.1; see `alium_Nunito-OFL.txt`.

The 12 palettes are `alium_default` (Allium), `alium_alliumboy`, `alium_blue`,
`alium_boxart`, `alium_brown`, `alium_bubblegum`, `alium_eva_01`, `alium_min`,
`alium_pastel`, `alium_snes`, `alium_spruceos`, and `alium_synthwave`.

These are color ports, not layout or wallpaper ports. Source RGB components
are converted to FrogUI's RGB565 format; alpha is omitted because the palette
has no opacity fields. Wallpaper-only backgrounds therefore become solid
colors. Theme selection and font selection remain independent; some other
Allium themes choose fonts other than Nunito.

FrogUI background, text, selection, selected text, and disabled colors map
directly to the matching Allium UI fields. Headers use `tab_selected_color`,
folders use `text_color`, legends use `button_hints.text_color`, and legend
bars use the UI background. Per-button colors have no FrogUI palette field.
